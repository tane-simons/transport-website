## Reflection
The website features many principles of interaction and user centred design, specifically in regard to visibility, feedback, consistency, and accessibility. This is designed for an audience potentially composed of transport enthusiasts and website curators, as the site has ease of access to items and has metadata for each.

In order to aid in the navigation of a site, especially with a significant amount of content, good visibility is a necessity (Nielson, 1994). The navigation of the website provides multiple options for navigation: in the navigation bar, the collections view, and the footer. The abundance and focus on these options create a visible interface promoting effective user interaction design. The incorporation of visibility prompts the user into exploring more of the website, whilst allowing users that are searching for a specific item to effectively and efficiently find it.

Following this, feedback is used throughout the site to highlight content that the user can interact with. When hovering over options in the navigation bar, the background of the text highlights, visibly displaying to the user that they may click an option and be taken to the relevant page. Additionally, when hovering over any collection or item, the content will transition to expand, also establishing a sense of interactivity and prompting the user to click the image. This feedback provides the user with clear consequences of interactions, encouraging them to explore the interface. (Nielson, 1994)

Likewise, consistency is demonstrated through this feedback, as interactive items have a transition effect throughout the site. Consistency can also be seen in the aesthetic choices of the colour palette, border styles, and page layouts. This aids the user by setting the same behaviour across each page, aligning with their expectations (Nielson, 1994).

Accessibility is a significant factor in user centred design. Therefore, the website features accessibility considerations such as semantic HTML (denoting `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` etc), and other screen reader accommodations like `alt=""` attributes for images and icons. This focus on accessibility promotes user centred design and inclusivity within interaction design as a whole (Henry, 2019). 

## Original Wireframe and Completed Site

## The Comparison
Overall, the original wireframe and finalised website share many commonalities, both in structure and principles of interaction design. Mostly, the structure of the website is identical to the wireframe. This is only deviated by small layout adjustments to better suit alignment and consistency, evident in the timeline.

The principles of interaction design also followed through from the wireframe, featuring easy and effective navigatability through the navigation bar, footer, and collections section. This was then followed by the chronological timeline layout of the items, which expand on hover.

The most prominent deviation from the original design was due to aesthetic choice as the colours in the moodboard were not adequate or fitting for the website. After many trials of different colour palettes, a blue and gold theme was settled upon due to its legibility and eleganc (Leo, 2023), with particular relation to the theme of transport through the likes of the Orient Express.
