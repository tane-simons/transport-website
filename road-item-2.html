                  History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing is known of the early history of this car from its purchase when new until the Museum acquired it. It was purchased from Mr. M. Hackett, an inventor, of Eastbourne Flats No. 2, 19 Imperial Avenue, Bondi, New South Wales on 29th March, 1967. The car was restored in 1976 by apprentices from the School of Vehicles Trades, at Sydney Technical College.

              <p>
                Wooden motor bodies were built to travel thousands of miles without being shaken to bits, to be left out in the rain and changing temperatures without becoming warped and losing their smooth finish and colour. Timber had to be seasoned so that it would not warp as it dried out. This was done artificially in kilns and then stored for a period. From storage it was taken to the milling bay where it was cut to certain sizes and all knots and defects cut out. The timber originally used was English ash, however Australian timbers were found to be just as good, if not better, than the imported wood which was hard to obtain during the first World War. 
</p>
<p>
    There were around 200 pieces of timber used in the manufacture of a Holden body, excluding interior trimming. Then followed the setting-up process in which the finished wooden parts were placed in large jigs/moveable platforms made especially for each model of car body. These pieces were then screwed, bolted and/or glued together. Originally this was with white lead as it was waterproof and early glues were not. The lower parts of the body were framed up first. The side pillars were erected next, followed by the wheel arch, front cross-framing, the roof framing and then the back frame. The driver's seating area and side doors were left till last. While the body was being set up braces were used to keep the timbers in place, giving the body strength and rigidity. Pannelling and seat construction were generally constructed separately and then placed inside the car once the timber frame was completed.
</p>
<p>
    The outside of the body was then covered with thin steel panels that were pressed by mechanical presses. These panels were originally hand beaten on sand-filled sacks before presses were used. Welding, which had only been used industrially since 1903, was used in some cases to join the metal panels together, which were then polished to a smooth finish for painting. Paint was then sprayed onto the panel by primitive spray guns.
</p>
<p>
    Further trimmings were added to complete the body, such as polished wood, panelling, door locks, striking plates and silencers. Some trim such as interior doorhandles were made of a plastic called "fibro-monolithe", which could be applied like a plaster that dried hard.
</p>
<p>
    The 1929 Chrysler appeared with new slender profile radiators and long sweeping lines. It also had internal expanding brakes and their body styling and ribbon-type radiator shells were widely imitated in Europe over the next few years. Chrysler sold 98,000 cars in America in 1929, whilst Holden produced bodies for 626 Chyrslers in Australia that year.
</p>
<p>
    The rear quarter window handles are actually Chevrolet parts for the Chevrolet models of 1929. Such parts were generally interchanged by body builders.
